**Hello! I created this website to share my favorite things. Hope you enjoy it!**

## Favorite Game:

**Genshin Impact**

[Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com) is a massively multiplayer online role-play game (MMORPG) which is an open-world game which can be played casually or for meta-purposes. This is the reason why it is one of the best-selling games right now and my most favorite game.

## Favorite Food:

**Pancit**

When it comes to food, I _LOVE_ most of them. But there is that one dish which I always love to eat and never get tired of. It is [pancit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancit) because it has a unique taste that is my cup of tea and when I eat this, I will be reminded of my nostalgic memories.

## Favorite Anime:

**Kimi No Na Wa (Your Name)**

In my opinion, Kimi No Na Wa is such an awesome movie, I will think about it even after you watch it. The concept, the song track, the animation all are mind blowing.

## Favorite Song:

**I Can't Stop Me**

I Can't Stop Me is a K-Pop song that I really love because of its unique and catchy tone and the lyrics has a deep meaning into our universal truth.
