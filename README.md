Hello! I created this website to share my favorite things. Hope you enjoy it!

### **FAVORITE GAME:**

## Genshin Impact
[Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com) is a massively multiplayer online role-play game (MMORPG) which is an open-world game which can be played casually or for meta-purposes. This is the reason why it is one of the best-selling games right now and my most favorite game.
